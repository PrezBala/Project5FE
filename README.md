# Development Goals

The objective of this API is to function as a backend service, enabling the FlickRater frontend application to carry out Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations through its user interface.

# Agile Planning

This project was developed following agile principles, with a series of four sprints. Each feature was prioritized and labeled as either "must-have," "should-have," or "could-have." We began by implementing the must-have features, followed by the should-have features, and finally addressed the could-have features if time and resources permitted. This approach ensured the delivery of a comprehensive website, with optional enhancements added based on capacity.

The Kanban board, created using GitHub Projects, facilitated project management and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/users/PrezBala/projects/1/views/1). For more detailed information on each task, simply click on the respective view.

# API Endpoints

API Endpoints

User Story:

As a developer, I need to establish the base project setup for the construction of requisite features.

Implementation:

The foundational project was formulated, and a virtual environment was created with all necessary packages installed and solidified into the requirements.

Secret variables were hidden and settings were modified to distinguish between the development and production environments.

User Story:

As a user, I need the capability to create a new account to gain access to all features exclusive to registered users.

Implementation:

To harness their built-in authentication system, Django rest framework and dj_rest_auth were installed, added to the URL patterns, and incorporated into the site packages.

User Story:

As a developer, I need to generate API views for movie enthusiasts for their utilization on the front end.

Implementation:

Endpoint: /api/movies

Methods:

POST - Utilized for creating a Movie listing.

GET - Utilized for retrieving a list of Movies.

As a developer, I need to have the ability to observe the users that have been created.

Implementation:

Endpoint: /api/users

Methods:

POST - Utilized for creating a new user.

GET - Utilized for retrieving a list of users and their respective staff ratings.

# Security

- A permission class, named 'class IsAdminUser(permissions.BasePermission)', was implemented to ensure that only administrators are granted access to the admin section and possess the rights to delete all movie listings, among other admin-exclusive functionalities.

- I've implemented a middleware.py script within my API, designed to validate whether the user making the request is authenticated or possesses superuser status. Without these credentials, access to protected sections, such as the admin area, will be denied. Any attempt by a user to access the admin page without the proper credentials will result in them being redirected to the homepage.

# Testing

During the development process, I used the Postman application to test the API endpoints using GET, POST,PUT and DELETE functions with various URLs. Below are the results of the tests:

I tested the GET function for the API to verify that movies and ratings are returned correctly. The screenshot below shows the response:

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testone.png">

I tested the POST function within the api/movies/ endpoint to confirm that adding a new movie title and description is successful. The following screenshot demonstrates the test:

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testtwo.png">

In the next screenshot, I attempted to add a new movie titled 'Avatar' with the description 'sci-fi':

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testthree.png">

After using the POST function, the successful response was returned, as shown in the screenshot below:

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testfour.png">

I also tested the PUT function under the api/movies/ endpoint to ensure that I can modify the movie description or title. In the screenshot below, I amended the description of 'Evil Dead' to 'Romantic':

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testfive.png">

To test the rating system, I attempted to set the value to 10 for the stars, even though the maximum allowed value is 5. The backend code correctly handles this situation, and the response informs that the value should be less than or equal to 5, as shown below:

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testelevenparttwo.png">

Response should return text to advise value should be less or equal to 5 which is what it is showing below.

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testeleven.png">

Additionally, I tested to ensure that only numerical input is allowed for the rating, and alphabetic characters are rejected. Using the POST function, I provided alphabetic letters, and the response correctly states that a valid integer is required:

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testtwelve.png">

The APIs were tested locally during the development phase. However, the comprehensive testing of the APIs was performed as part of the front-end repositories, where I tested them manually using form inputs and page loads. You can find the detailed results in the "FlickRater FE" repository.

## Validator Results

During the development process, I ran all the folders through Flake8, a code style checker, to ensure code quality. Flake8 identified several issues such as lines being too long, unnecessary blank spaces, incorrect indentation, and missing or incorrect docstring (example shown below)

<img src="https://github.com/PrezBala/Project5API/blob/main/readme/testfifteen.png">

I resolved all the identified issues, except for the lines that were too long in the migration files. These files are automatically generated by the framework, so I did not make any changes to them. Additionally, I also encountered lines that were too long in the authentication validator section of the settings.py file, which appeared to be unbreakable due to being framework code. Therefore, I couldn't fix those specific lines.

One warning was raised about the env.py file being imported but unused. However, this file is utilized in the development version, so I disregarded this warning.

By addressing the identified issues and resolving them, I ensured that the code complied with the established coding conventions and best practices.

Several 'spacing' and 'line too long' errors were detected within the virtual environment (venv) libraries. After consultation with both student support and my mentor, it was confirmed that these errors can be disregarded, as they do not originate from the code I have written.

# Deployment

## Version Control

The site was developed using the Codeanywhere editor and pushed to the remote repository named 'Project5API' on GitHub.

Throughout the development process, the following Git commands were used to push code to the remote repository:

git commit -m "commit message": After adding the necessary files to the staging area, this command was used to commit the changes to the local repository with a descriptive commit message.

git push: Finally, this command was used to push all the committed code from the local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

By utilizing these Git commands, the code changes made during development were properly staged, committed, and pushed to the remote repository, ensuring that the latest version of the code was available on the GitHub repository 'Project5API'.

# Heroku Deployment

To deploy the site to Heroku, I followed these steps:

I navigated to the Heroku website (<https://www.heroku.com/>)

Once logged in, I clicked the "New" button located in the top-right corner of the dashboard.

I selected "Create new app" from the dropdown menu.

I provided an app name of my choice.

I chose the appropriate region and clicked the "Create app" button.

In the dashboard for my app, I navigated to the "Resources" tab.

I went to the "Settings" tab and clicked on "Reveal Config Vars".

I added the following config vars:

SECRET_KEY: My secret key
DATABASE_URL: This was already present (automatically added when provisioning Heroku Postgres)
CLOUDINARY_URL: Cloudinary URL (if applicable)
DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC: I set this to any non-empty value to disable automatic static file collection during deployment.
I scrolled down to the "Connect to GitHub" section and clicked the "Connect" button. I signed in to my GitHub account and authorized the Heroku integration.

In the search box, I found the repository I wanted to deploy and clicked the "Connect" button next to it.

I scrolled down to the "Manual deploy" section and chose the desired branch, typically the "main" branch.

Finally, I clicked the "Deploy" button to start the deployment process.

Heroku then built and deployed my application. I could monitor the progress in the activity logs. Once the deployment was completed, I accessed my deployed site using the provided Heroku URL.

## Run Locally

To clone the GitHub repository and use it locally, I followed these steps:

I navigated to the GitHub repository I wanted to clone.

I clicked on the "Code" drop-down button.

From the options, I selected "HTTPS" to obtain the repository's HTTPS URL.

I copied the repository URL to my clipboard.

Then, I opened my preferred IDE or code editor (making sure that Git was installed on my machine).

In the terminal or command prompt within my IDE, I typed git clone <copied-git-url>, replacing <copied-git-url> with the repository's URL. Pressing Enter executed the command.

As a result, the project was cloned from the GitHub repository and made available on my local machine.

To run the project, I followed these additional steps:

I created an env.py file in the project directory.

Inside the env.py file, I added the necessary configuration variables mentioned in the earlier Heroku steps.

Next, I configured the environment variables locally by referring to the appropriate instructions for my operating system. I followed a guide [here](https://able.bio/rhett/how-to-set-and-get-environment-variables-in-python--274rgt5#:~:text=To%20set%20and%20get%20environment%20variables%20in%20Python%20you%20can,Get%20environment%20variables%20USER%20%3D%20os.).

Finally, I set up a virtual environment using the following commands:

For Windows:

Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
For Mac/Linux:

bash

Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
By following these steps, I successfully cloned the GitHub repository to my local machine and set up the necessary environment to run the project.
